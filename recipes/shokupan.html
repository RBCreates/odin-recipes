        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <h4>Creating the Tangzhong</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Create the tangzhong by mixing water and milk in a pot set at a medium temperature until it reaches a light simmer. </li>
            <li>When the mixture reaches a light simmer, gradually add the bread flour and mix continuously.</li>
            <li>Once the tangzhong is semi-transparent, transfer it to a new container for cooling.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Forming the Dough</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a stand mixer with the dough hook attachment, mix bread flour, sugar, and instant dry yeast at the lowest speed. 
            <li>Gradually add the tangzhong into the stand mixer making sure that it fully incorporates into the dry mix.</li>
            <li>Increase the speed of the stand mixer by 1 level then add in 2 eggs, milk and salt.</li>
            <li>Once all the ingredients are incorporated and form a shaggy-like dough, mix in the butter.
                Make sure to periodically stop the mixer if the butter sticks to the bowl.</li>
            <li>The dough is ready once it passes the <a href="https://www.greenpark.co.uk/recipe/try-the-windowpane-test-when-kneading-dough/#:~:text=Take%20a%20small%20ball%20of,your%20dough%20is%20properly%20kneaded." target="_blank">windowpane test</a>.</li>
            <li>Let the dough rest in a greased (with butter) bowl and cover with plastic wrap until it doubles in volume. Approximately 1 hr depending on kitchen temperature. </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Shaping and Baking the Dough</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>On a clean surface, begin dividing the dough into 3 equal parts each roughly weighing 330g.</li>
            <li>Roll each piece into a rectangle and fold the long ends into the middle. Then roll the dough from the top to the bottom and seal.</li>
