# odin-recipes
This is an HTML project on creating a website to display cooking recipes.

In this project, the key lesson I practiced are relative and absolute links in the form of images and hyperlinks. 
1. In the index page, I used relative links to the recipes pages
2. In the shokupan page, I used relative links for images using the img tag
3. In the cheesecake and cookies pages, I used absolute links for images
